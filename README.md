# The Collection

## Introduction

The Collection is a public catalogue of recommended apps, command line tools, and resources.

It gives visitors a simple way to browse published tools by search, platform, category, and tags. The private owner-only admin area is used to add, edit, draft, publish, and delete tools without exposing unpublished entries to the public site.

## Features

- Browse a public catalogue of recommended tools and resources.
- Search tools by name, description, tags, platform, and category.
- Filter published tools by platform and category.
- Manage tools through a private owner-only admin area.
- Upload or link tool logos and keep uploaded files in persistent storage.

## Stack

- Node.js 22
- Next.js App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Prisma
- SQLite
- `bcryptjs` for admin password hashing
- Docker and Docker Compose
- GitHub Container Registry
- GitHub Actions

## Requirements

Before running this project, install:

- Node.js 22
- npm
- Docker and Docker Compose, for container testing or server deployment
- OpenSSL, for generating a local session secret

## Configuration (.env)

1. Create a local `.env` file from the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2. Update `.env` with values for your local setup:

    ```bash
    ADMIN_USERNAME=collection-admin
    ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=replace-with-output-from-npm-run-password-hash
    SESSION_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-string
    DATABASE_URL=file:./data/the-collection.db
    DATA_DIR=./data
    ```

3. Generate an admin password hash:

    ```bash
    npm run password:hash -- "your-strong-password"
    ```

    The command prints an `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=...` line that is escaped safely for a Next.js `.env` file. Keep the plain password in your password manager, not in the project.

    For a Docker Compose `.env` file, generate the hash in Compose-safe format instead:

    ```bash
    npm run password:hash -- --compose "your-strong-password"
    ```

4. Generate a session secret:

    ```bash
    openssl rand -base64 48
    ```

Environment notes:

- `ADMIN_USERNAME` is the owner username allowed to access the admin area.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` is the bcrypt hash for the admin password. Use the normal hash command for local Next.js development, and use the `--compose` form for Docker Compose deployments so `$` characters are not treated as environment variable references.
- `SESSION_SECRET` signs admin session cookies. Keep it long, random, and stable for a deployment.
- `DATABASE_URL` controls the SQLite database path. Local npm development uses `file:./data/the-collection.db`.
- `DATA_DIR` is where uploaded logos and app data are stored. Local development can use `./data`.

## Test Locally

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Create and update `.env` using the configuration steps above.

3. Create the SQLite database and seed sample tools:

    ```bash
    npm run db:init
    npm run db:seed
    ```

4. Start the app:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

6. Before handing off changes, run:

    ```bash
    npm run typecheck
    npm run lint
    npm run build
    ```

## Test Locally Using Docker

Docker is useful for checking the container before server deployment. The local Compose file builds the image from this repository, reads `.env`, publishes the app on `127.0.0.1:3000`, and stores app data in the `the-collection-data` Docker volume.

1. Start the local Docker stack:

    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

    The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

2. Stop the stack:

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

>[!Note]
The local Compose file is `docker-compose.yaml`. The production source Compose file is `docker-compose.prod.yaml`.

## Server Deployment

You can run this on your own server by pulling the latest Docker image from `ghcr.io/aut0nate/the-collection:${IMAGE_TAG:-latest}`.

Use the structure that fits your own environment and preferred deployment methods. For public-facing access, put the service behind HTTPS using a reverse proxy such as Nginx Proxy Manager, Caddy, Traefik, or another preferred option. In my environment, I am using Nginx Proxy Manager with a docker network named `edge-net`.

For most Docker-based deployments:

1. Create a directory in your chosen location on your server, for example `/opt/stacks/the-collection`.
2. Change into this directory.
3. Ensure the production Compose file is saved in this directory. In this repository the production source file is `docker-compose.prod.yaml`, but the associated GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow should save it as `docker-compose.yaml`.
4. Create a `.env` file:

    ```bash
    ADMIN_USERNAME=collection-admin
    ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=replace-with-output-from-npm-run-password-hash-compose
    SESSION_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-string
    IMAGE_TAG=latest
    ```

    Generate the production password hash with:

    ```bash
    npm run password:hash -- --compose "your-strong-password"
    ```

    The production Compose file sets `DATABASE_URL=file:/app/data/the-collection.db` and `DATA_DIR=/app/data` inside the container. Do not set local paths such as `./data` for the production container.

5. Create the external Docker network or create your own and update the production Compose file accordingly.

    ```bash
    docker network create edge-net
    ```

6. Start the public image using the Compose file name on your server:

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
    ```

7. Configure your reverse proxy to the app container on port `3000`.
8. Verify the public URL after deployment.

Example production files:

- `docker-compose.prod.yaml`
- `docker-compose.yaml`
- `.env`

After deployment, verify:

- The public homepage loads.
- `/admin/login` loads.
- Admin login works.
- Tool search and filters work.
- Data and logos remain available after restarting the container.

Back up the SQLite database and uploaded logos regularly from the `the-collection-data` Docker volume or from your chosen mounted storage location.

## GitHub Actions

- `CI - Validate and build` should run on pull requests and pushes to `main`.
- CI should install dependencies, run linting, run type checks, build the Next.js application, build a Docker image, and smoke test the container locally.
- `CD - Build and deploy` should run only after CI succeeds on `main`.
- CD should build and push `ghcr.io/aut0nate/the-collection:latest` and `ghcr.io/aut0nate/the-collection:<commit-sha>`.
- CD should upload `docker-compose.prod.yaml` to the server as `docker-compose.yaml`, update `IMAGE_TAG` in the server `.env`, then run `docker compose pull` and `docker compose up -d`.
- Deployment SSH details should be stored in GitHub Actions secrets: `VPS_HOST`, `VPS_PORT`, `VPS_USER`, and `VPS_SSH_KEY`.
- Production runtime values should live in the server `.env`, not in the workflow files.

## Security Notes

- Do not commit `.env`.
- Keep `SESSION_SECRET` long and random.
- Use `npm run password:hash` rather than storing a plain password.
- The admin login uses bcrypt password hashes, timing-safe comparisons, signed HTTP-only cookies, and short in-memory throttling after repeated failed login attempts.
- Store production secrets in the deployment environment or GitHub Actions secrets, not in the repository.
- Use a unique admin password for production and rotate `SESSION_SECRET` if it is ever exposed. Rotating the secret signs every existing admin session out.
- Public visitors only see published tools that are intended to be public.
